# Bio-Inspired Low Frequency Underwater Acoustic Modem (WhaleDem)
Although oceans represent 70% of the Earth's surface, communication underwater is still proving to be an incredibly difficult task. Light and odour don't travel very well, and we can't use our conventional communication methods since they simply just do not work underwater.
However, sound moves at **1.5km/s** in water, as opposed to **343m/s** in air, which is 4 times as much. This in fact is what marine mammals have been using to communicate with each other over long distances. Amongst them are whales. Whale 'songs', patterns of regular and predictable noises, are some of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. 
They constitute the basis of our inspiration for our implementation. 

## How it Works

## Limitations
1. **Bandwith** That the frequency of the acoustic waves is so low that it limits communication speed to around a kilobit per second. To put that in perspective, average broadband speeds are around 50 megabits per second (50,000 times as fast).
2. **Environmental factors**
